# ========================================
# SAFENET SHIELD - FIREBASE SECURITY CONFIGURATION
# ========================================

# HOW TO DEPLOY THESE RULES:

## 1. FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES
# Copy the content from firestore.rules to your Firebase Console:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Firestore Database -> Rules
# 2. Replace existing rules with the comprehensive rules provided
# 3. Click "Publish" to deploy

## 2. FIREBASE STORAGE RULES  
# Copy the content from storage.rules to your Firebase Console:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Storage -> Rules
# 2. Replace existing rules with the comprehensive storage rules
# 3. Click "Publish" to deploy

## 3. FIREBASE AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION
# Configure Authentication settings in Firebase Console:
# 1. Go to Firebase Console -> Authentication -> Settings
# 2. Enable Email/Password, Google, and Phone providers
# 3. Configure password policy as specified in firebase-auth-config.json
# 4. Enable Multi-Factor Authentication

## 4. CUSTOM CLAIMS SETUP
# Implement custom claims in your Firebase Functions:

const admin = require('firebase-admin');

// Function to set user roles and permissions
exports.setUserClaims = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Verify admin access
  if (!context.auth || context.auth.token.role !== 'admin') {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('permission-denied', 'Admin access required');
  }
  
  const { uid, role, permissions } = data;
  
  // Set custom claims
  await admin.auth().setCustomUserClaims(uid, {
    role: role,
    ...permissions,
    lastUpdated: Date.now()
  });
  
  return { success: true };
});

## 5. SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED:

### Authentication Security:
- ✅ Email verification required for all users
- ✅ Multi-factor authentication for sensitive roles
- ✅ Strong password policy (12+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- ✅ Account lockout after failed attempts
- ✅ Session management with timeout
- ✅ Device registration and trust

### Authorization Security:
- ✅ Role-based access control (RBAC)
- ✅ Resource-level permissions
- ✅ Time-based access restrictions
- ✅ Owner-based access control
- ✅ Legal authority verification

### Data Security:
- ✅ Field-level validation
- ✅ Data size limits
- ✅ File type restrictions
- ✅ Immutable evidence records
- ✅ Encrypted sensitive data
- ✅ Audit trail for all actions

### Network Security:
- ✅ Rate limiting per user/function
- ✅ IP-based restrictions (optional)
- ✅ Geolocation validation
- ✅ Request validation and sanitization

### Compliance & Legal:
- ✅ Evidence preservation (no deletion)
- ✅ Chain of custody tracking
- ✅ Legal discovery support
- ✅ Audit trail for compliance
- ✅ Data retention policies
- ✅ GDPR/privacy considerations
